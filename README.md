A button to reset a webcam when its microphone goes haywire

___

My friend in Canada, whom I video call a lot, has a recurring issue with her webcam: her laughter is fairly high-pitched and sharp, which causes the microphone in her webcam to start resonating at a *very* annoying frequency... and it won't stop unless she unplugs it, and plugs it back in again!

Of course, she doesn't know when this issue occurs unless I tell her about it, at which point she has to go digging at the back of her PC to find the right plug... which can take a couple tries! Understandably, she gets pretty aggravated at the webcam every time this happens, now.

I decided that, since this issue happens somewhat frequently, I'm going to do something about it.
